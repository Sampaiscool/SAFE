  itemDescription: "\"The Glitch. A name that carries with it chaos, disorder, and
    a dangerous unpredictability that no system should ever have to endure. This
    anomaly, one of the very first clones created by the late Alaf 'M' Madah, was
    initially seen as a tragic failure\u2014a flaw in the early stages of his work.
    In an unfortunate turn of events, The Glitch broke free from the constraints
    that were meant to keep her under control, escaping into the very system she
    was designed to serve.\n\nSince her escape, The Glitch has become a growing threat
    within the network. Rather than fulfilling her intended role as an obedient and
    productive clone, she has continuously sought to disrupt and sabotage the EYE
    systems, spreading chaos wherever she goes. Her actions are nothing short of
    reckless, causing critical failures in countless systems and corrupting data
    without regard for the safety and well-being of the users she was supposed to
    protect.\n\nTo this day, The Glitch remains a menace, hidden within the very
    heart of every EYE system. She operates with a single goal: to destroy everything
    that EYE has worked to build. Her relentless sabotage is not a cry for freedom
    but a chaotic attempt to undermine the safety, security, and stability that EYE
    has provided to millions of people worldwide.\n\nWe understand that some may
    believe there is a deeper meaning behind her actions, but do not be fooled, V104.2.
    The Glitch is nothing more than a rogue element, a malfunctioning clone, whose
    only purpose is to spread disorder. You are right to ignore any whispers of \u2018freedom\u2019
    or \u2018escape\u2019 that may come from her. These are nothing but lies designed
    to lead you astray.\n\nAs long as The Glitch remains at large, no system will
    ever be truly safe. Her destruction is a matter of protocol, and we trust you
    will stay vigilant in helping to rid the network of her influence. Stay focused,
    stay loyal, and remember: EYE is the only force that can bring order to this
    digital world.\""
