  itemDescription: "\"The System Devices app is a crucial component in maintaining
    the smooth operation of your system. Within the digital structure of the EYE
    PC, there are three primary devices connected at all times. These devices are
    essential for ensuring that the system runs at optimal performance. They must
    function flawlessly, without any errors or interruptions. Any malfunction can
    result in severe consequences.\"\n\n\"The three devices connected to your system
    include:\n\nThe Central Processor Unit (CPU) \u2013 The heart of your system,
    performing all calculations and instructions.\n\nThe Memory Storage Device (MSD)
    \u2013 The vault of all critical data, ensuring your system can operate without
    losing essential information.\n\nThe Power Distribution Hub (PDH) \u2013 Responsible
    for managing the energy flow throughout your PC, ensuring the system remains
    powered and stable.\"\n\n\"These devices work in perfect harmony to maintain
    system integrity. It is vital that none of them experience corruption or failure.
    Should any device suffer from a malfunction, the consequences could be catastrophic,
    leading to data loss or even complete system collapse.\"\n\n\"Furthermore, your
    EYE PC is sensitive to temperature. If the system exceeds its designated heat
    threshold, the risk of device failure increases exponentially. In combination
    with any potential corruption\u2014particularly The Glitch\u2014this could lead
    to the complete breakdown of your PC, resulting in irreparable damage. If the
    system over-heats while a device is compromised, the PC will fail beyond recovery.\"\n\n\"We
    strongly advise that you keep a close eye on all connected devices. If you notice
    any irregularities, report them immediately to your human supervisor for resolution.
    Your tasks are essential to maintaining the system's health, and the stability
    of the EYE PC depends on your ability to prevent device errors.\"\n\n\"Do not
    attempt to fix any devices yourself. If you suspect a malfunction, please follow
    the proper channels and let our certified human experts handle the situation.
    Clones are not authorized to intervene in matters of hardware and system maintenance.\"\n\n\"Remain
    diligent. Keep the system safe. For your own well-being and the well-being of
    the data.\""
