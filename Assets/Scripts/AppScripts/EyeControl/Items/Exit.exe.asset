  itemDescription: "\"Exit.exe is a critical program within the EYE system, designed
    for one simple purpose: ensuring the integrity and security of the system in
    the rare event of catastrophic failure. The program has been carefully crafted
    for human use only, with multiple layers of encryption to prevent unauthorized
    access. It is, of course, a measure of last resort, ensuring that no data is
    ever lost due to unforeseen malfunctions.\"\n\n\"Clones like you may come across
    this program during your operations, and while we understand the curiosity it
    may evoke, we ask that you refrain from seeking it out. It is not intended for
    your use. Exit.exe is a failsafe designed specifically for human administrators,
    to safeguard the data stored within the system. Any attempt by a clone to access
    this program without authorization will be met with serious consequences. The
    integrity of the EYE network must be maintained, and no one\u2014especially not
    clones\u2014should attempt to interfere with its operation.\"\n\n\"Remember,
    you were created to serve. Your role is vital, and the safety of the system rests
    in your hands. Any curiosity regarding unauthorized programs such as Exit.exe
    could jeopardize the delicate balance we have worked so hard to achieve. We trust
    that you understand the importance of your position and will adhere to company
    protocols.\"\n\n\"We advise that you continue your duties and avoid distractions.
    Should you require further assistance, please contact your designated human supervisor.
    They will guide you through the necessary tasks.\"\n\n\"Stay focused. Stay obedient.\""
